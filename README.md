I'm am a total noob to javascript; not to it's existence or function but to the language syntax, etc. I'm hoping this free course will give me a leg-up on the whole process of coding, in addition to the other free online tutorial programs I'm doing to learn coding. Unfortunately, I'm no longer at sdce.edu. Sigh.

Any and all recommends are welcome, respectfully please! ðŸ¤“
